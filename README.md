## How to create a single page website.
HTML & CSS Workshop for Let's Code Together May 26, 2018
This demo consists of 2 pages:
1) hello.html
2) styles.css

### HTML
hello.html shows the skeleton of a website, using the basic building blocks of an HTML page.  
It includes headers, ordered & unordered lists, links and images.

### CSS
The site also uses simple CSS styling. Styling is included in styles.css, which is then referenced in the <head> of hello.HTML
Feel free to clone this site and make it your own, personalising with colors, fonts, information about yourself and your own links & images.
