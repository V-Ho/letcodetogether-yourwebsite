## Part 2 of the HTML & CSS Workshop 
### Let's Code Together - May 26, 2018

This workshop provides a template for a single page portfolio site with sections for 'Home', 'About' & 'Contact'.
There are 3 files for this site:
1) index.html
2) styles.css
3) beach.jpeg

### HTML
hello.html shows the skeleton of a website, using the basic building blocks of an HTML page.  
It includes headers, ordered & unordered lists, links and linked images.

### CSS
The site also uses simple CSS styling. Styling is included in styles.css, which is then referenced in the <head> of hello.HTML
Feel free to clone this site and make it your own, personalising with colors, fonts, information about yourself and your own links & images.
  
### Deploying
When you are finished, you can deploy your site by dragging and dropping a folder contain HTML, CSS & JS files here:

And voila, you can share your own personal site with family and friends!
